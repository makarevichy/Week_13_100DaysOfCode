# Week 13

### Days 86-88: August 13-15.

**Today's Progress**: Keras package, tensorflow.

**Thoughts** 
- I will continue to study the Keras package. I read various literature on convolutional neural networks. Deepened in studying tensorflow. 
- And most importantly, I got a new job as a data analyst in a large insurance company, where I will be engaged in the construction of machine learning models!

### Days 83-85: August 10-12.

**Today's Progress**: Keras package.

**Thoughts** 
- The last three days I taught Keras in R programming. Worked with text sequences, with LSTM. I worked with merging layers. The days were interesting and productive.
